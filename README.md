# Cold-Night
Dark Theme for the 4chan site

### Compatibility

- [x] 4Chan Vanilla
- [ ] Lainchan
### A little more about this

I'm making this theme to practice and to keep learning CSS.

I want to give it modern styles, with strong colors but without being annoying to the eye, and at the same time preserving the style or essence of the page.

Âª and the dark theme for the view.

### How to add these ugly styles to 4chan?

<a href = "add_styles.md">Here</a>
### Another thing

Make sure you have that enabled in **Firefox**, in <a href = "about:config">about:config</a> if you want to use the Blurred variant.

that's right, enter this in Firefox <a href = "about:config">about:config</a>

<pre>
layout.css.backdrop-filter.enabled
</pre>
